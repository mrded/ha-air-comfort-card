# Air Comfort Card

A custom Home Assistant card that visualizes indoor air comfort using temperature and humidity sensors. It displays a circular "comfort dial" with a moving dot indicator showing whether conditions are cold, warm, dry, humid, or comfortable — plus 24-hour history charts for temperature, humidity, and CO2.

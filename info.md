# Air Comfort Card

A custom Home Assistant card that visualizes indoor air comfort using temperature and humidity sensors. It displays a circular "comfort dial" with a moving dot indicator showing whether conditions are cold, warm, dry, humid, or comfortable — plus 24-hour history charts for temperature, humidity, CO2, NO2, PM 2.5, PM 10, and VOC.
